## Carpentries next level - CodeRefinery model
**Sabry Razick, 20-07-2020**

### What is next level ?

* Software carpentry is focused on providing basic skills needed to start going 
  through a peer assisted learning pedagogy.
* Once these basics are mastered and start applying on real world scenarios a 
  deeper knowledge of certain aspects is needed.
* These more advanced topics can not be directly appended to existing material 
  material due to reasons like;
  * The topics becomes overly complicated and become not suited for 
    the carpentry style introduction
  * More experience instructors on the topic needed to deliver the lessons. 
  * The target audience is more narrow, so would not fit in a general software
     carpentry workshop
  * For example:
    * When using Git in the real world  more details about branches is
      needed than what is thought in “Version Control with Git”


### [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org) model

* Inspired by the Carpenters project and follow Carpentry pedagogy
* Provide the next level [lessons](https://coderefinery.org/lessons)  (as described before)
* It is funded by Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration ( [NeIC](https://neic.no/) ) 
  and most instructors are indirectly financed so not a fully voluntary effort 
* Lessons are developed with  the intention of Carpentries would absorb the 
  teaching material in the future.
